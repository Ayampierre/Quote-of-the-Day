#Project code example

This project was inspired by Professor Thomas' calcGUI code located on his Github account page at https://github.com/dominict/pythonteachingcode. 
The code features uses tkinter to display a calculator on a user's desktop. Features such as math imports, a class, and definitions are used. 

The code runs well and I expect to use the overall structure for my project, while adding my unique code along the way. Given the purposes for this project, I will use the Application frame code to display a 'calculator' on screen and use unique functions rather than importing math.
